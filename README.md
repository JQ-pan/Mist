# Welcome to **Mist**
_Welcome to Mist, your one-stop destination for all things gaming â€“ from discovering and purchasing games to sharing reviews._

Mist [(live link)](https://mist.onrender.com/) is a homage to the video game distribution system known as Steam, which was developed by Valve Corporation. Instead of modern video games, I have opted to use Nintendo Entertainment System games which were some of the most popular arcade games in the early 1980s.
